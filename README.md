# full-stack-test-template

A monorepo template to fork or use as reference for our full-stack test.

There are also READMEs in each workspace, though they are just the default READMEs generated by NestJS & Vite.

# Prerequisites
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) or [Node.js v20.12.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack) _(We recommend installing with Corepack)_
- (Optional) [nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/installation) for running workspaces

# Technologies

Just like the stack we use in our monorepo, this monorepo uses [**NestJS**](https://docs.nestjs.com/) for the API, and **React** (bundled by [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)) for the front end web app. We use **pnpm** for our package manager, which also manages the workspaces within the monorepo.

# Getting Started

After installing the prerequisites, you can use `nvm` to install & path the correct Node version based on the `.nvmrc` in this repository.

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

You can use `nx`, either from a global install or with `pnpx`, to run workspace scripts from each workspace. There are more details on [their website](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx) but for some quick examples:

- `pnpx nx run api:start:dev` is going to `run` a package.json script in the `api` workspace, and the script is `start:dev`
- `pnpx nx run-many -t start:dev -p api web` is going to concurrently run the `start:dev` scripts in both `api` and `web` workspaces

# Other Scripts

- `pnpm run start:dev` - Runs both API and web app together, concurrently
